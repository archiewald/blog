# Hello again!

As it was said I am here to share with you my first monthly project from the 1-project-per-month challenge series.

It is a simple app made with React.js framework which basically helps to write single page applications using components. Sure it is capable to do much much more but one need to start somewhere, right :)?

# What about the app?

* It polls data from [free-to-use json api](https://www.football-data.org/),
* has a nice sliding menu component (pure css),
* you can select a league from top header and then the right table will be rendered in the main component.

# What I learned?

* __How data flows between React components.__ Frankly saying, even for such a simple app I find props based data flow not intuitive... [This article](https://medium.com/dailyjs/when-do-i-know-im-ready-for-redux-f34da253c85f) shows perfectly my struggles. This is why I decided to learn Redux right away!

* __How to deploy React app on github pages.__ Following [this tutorial](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) it was super easy!

* __To kick the perfectionist out of my mind.__ Am I satisfied with the functionalities of this app and how it looks? Sure not. I would rather wait another weeks to polish it, maybe finish not deploying anything. But deadlines are here to be met (end of each month) so I will continue to do it, following bellow sentence by Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn:

> If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, youâ€™ve launched too late.

Cheers!
