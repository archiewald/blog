Hi there!

To document my progress as a frontend developer I recently became, I decided to start writing a blog.

This is one thing, another is to fill this site with content. Next months I will challenge myself to release one post a month (at least) describing a small side-project.

# Few assumptions for each project:

* it will be a technical one (mostly frontend/javascript programming),
* have a repo on github,
* if only possible - deployed online,
* deadline to release and write a blogpost about it is last day of each month.

Credits for inspiration go to my old long-time-no-see friend Mateusz, who started this challenge as well some time ago. You can check out his technical blog here [msadowski.github.io](https://msadowski.github.io)

So I have just a one day left to publish my first project. Better get back to code :)

Cheers!
